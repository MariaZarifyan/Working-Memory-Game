# Working-Memory-Game

The game is available [here](https://mariazarifyan.github.io/Working-Memory-Game/) 

### How to play:

1. When the first round of the game starts, a random button is activated by the computer. 
2. You should press the same button. 
3. If you succeed, the sequence will get longer and more complicated, and you must memorize that random sequence and reproduce it by pressing the buttons. 
4. Once you fail, the game is over.
